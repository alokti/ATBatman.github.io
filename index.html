        <img src="B.img/wayne.PNG" alt="Bruce wayne" id="image">
        <p>Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne a wealthy American Industrialist who resides just outside of Gotham City.
        As a child Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents,Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne which ultimately led him to cast
        craft him batman persona and seek vengeance against criminals.Wayne averts suspicion by acting the  part of a superficial
        playboy idly living off his family's fortune,which was amassed through investment in real estate before the city become
        a bustling metropolis, and the profit of Wayne Enterprises,his inherited conglomerate.Bruce Wayne resides just outside 
        of Wayne Mansion.<br>
        He supports philanthropic causes through his 
        nonprofit Wayne Foundation, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite. In public, he appears frequently in the 
        company of high-status women, which encourages tabloid gossip. Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic 
        life, crime-fighting accounts for most of his time.
        He's developed an arsenal of technology that would put most armies to shame. And he's assembled teams of his fellow
        DC Super Heroes, like the Justice League, the Outsiders and Batman, Incorporated.</p>
